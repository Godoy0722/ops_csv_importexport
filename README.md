# OPS CSV Import Plugin

This plugin allows administrators to import users and preprints with their associated metadata in CSV format into OPS 3.5.X. The plugin can be used through both a web interface (GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI).

## Quick Start

### Web Interface

Navigate to **Tools → Import/Export → CSV Import Plugin**, select the import type (Preprints or Users), upload your CSV file or a ZIP archive, optionally enable Dry Mode, and click **Import**. See [Web Interface Usage](docs/web-interface.md) for details.

### CLI

Import users:

```bash
php tools/importExport.php CSVImportPlugin users [username] [pathToFolderWithCsvFiles] [--sendWelcomeEmail]
```

Import preprints:

```bash
php tools/importExport.php CSVImportPlugin preprints [username] [pathToFolderWithCsvFiles]
```

See [CLI Usage](docs/cli-usage.md) for parameter details and examples.

## Important Notes

> - The user obtained through the username will be the same one assigned to the submission files. It's also recommended that a dedicated importUser is created for this purpose with the Author role so that it's separate from existing Preprint Manager and editor user accounts.
> - The last CLI attribute must be the path to the folder containing the CSV file(s), not directly the CSV file itself.
> - The CSV file and any referenced files (PDFs, images) must be readable by the user running the CLI script.
> - The script must be executed from the OPS installation directory.
> - Ensure you have proper permissions to execute PHP scripts and access the files.
