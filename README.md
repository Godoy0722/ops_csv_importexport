## CSV File Format

## Data Structure Reference

### Authors Format

The `authors` field in the issues CSV must contain author information in the following format:

```
GivenName,FamilyName,Email,Affiliation;GivenName2,FamilyName2,Email2,Affiliation2
```

- Fields are separated by commas within each author
- Multiple authors are separated by semicolons
- All fields except GivenName are optional and can be left empty
- If email is empty, the primary contact email will be used

Examples:
```
"John,Doe,john@example.com,University of Example; Jane,Smith,,Another University"
"Maria,Silva,maria@example.com,"
"Carlos,,carlos@example.com,Example Corp"
```

### Keywords, Subjects, and Categories

These fields use a simple semicolon-separated format:

- **Keywords**: `keyword1; keyword two; another keyword`
- **Subjects**: `subject1; subject two; another subject`
- **Categories**: `Category1; Category Two; Another Category`

Notes:
- Leading/trailing spaces are automatically trimmed
- Empty values are ignored
- Categories will be created if they don't exist

### User Interests

User interests in the users CSV use a semicolon-separated format:

```
interest one; interest two; another interest
```

- Leading/trailing spaces are automatically trimmed
- Empty values are ignored
- Each interest will be associated with the user's profile

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### File and Path Issues
1. **File Not Found**
   - Error: `Could not read file: [file]. Error: [error]`
   - Solution:
     - Verify the file exists and the path is correct
     - Use absolute paths for reliability
     - For relative paths, they are resolved from the OJS root directory
     - Check file permissions (must be readable by the web server user)
     - Ensure the file is not empty

2. **Invalid Source Directory**
   - Error: `Invalid source dir: [dir]`
   - Solution:
     - Verify the directory exists and is accessible
     - Check for typos in the path
     - Ensure the web server user has read permissions

#### CSV Format Issues
3. **Missing or Invalid Fields**
   - Error: `Row doesn't contain all fields` or `Verify the required fields for this row`
   - Solution:
     - Check that all required columns are present in the CSV header
     - Ensure all rows have the same number of fields as the header
     - Verify there are no empty lines in the CSV file
     - Check for proper CSV escaping of fields containing commas or quotes

4. **Invalid Date Formats**
   - Error: `The subscription start/end date is not valid. Format required: YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Solution:
     - Ensure all dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
     - Verify dates are valid (e.g., no February 30)
     - Check that end dates are after start dates

#### User Import Issues
5. **User Already Exists**
   - Error: `User already exists with email/username [value]`
   - Solution:
     - Update existing users instead of creating new ones
     - Ensure usernames and emails are unique across the system
     - Check for case sensitivity in usernames/emails

6. **Role or Subscription Issues**
   - Error: `Role "[role]" doesn't exist` or `Invalid subscription type with ID [id]`
   - Solution:
     - Verify role names exactly match those in the system
     - Check that subscription type IDs exist in the database
     - Ensure required subscription fields (start_date, end_date) are provided

#### Issue Import Issues
7. **Server or Locale Issues**
   - Error: `Unknown server with path [path]` or `Unknown locale [locale]`
   - Solution:
     - Verify the server path in the CSV matches exactly
     - Check that the specified locale is enabled in the server
     - Ensure the server exists and is accessible to the importing user

8. **File Validation Errors**
   - Error: `Invalid [article/cover/galley] file for this submission`
   - Solution:
     - Verify all referenced files exist in the specified location
     - Check file permissions and formats
     - Ensure cover images are in a supported format (JPG, PNG)
     - Verify galley files match the specified labels

9. **Author and Metadata Issues**
   - Error: `There is no default author group in the server`
   - Solution:
     - Ensure the server has at least one author group configured
     - Verify author information follows the required format
     - Check that required author fields (first name) are provided

#### General Troubleshooting Tips
- Always back up your database before running imports
- Test with a small CSV file first
- Check the OJS error log for detailed error messages
- Ensure your CSV file is saved with UTF-8 encoding
- On Linux systems, check file permissions with `ls -l` and adjust with `chmod` if needed
- For large imports, monitor server resources as the process may be memory-intensive
